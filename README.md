# expo_app

STEPS: 
1. make sure node.js is installed
2. clone repo in desired folder
3. `cd` to your desired folder
4. use `npm run web` or `npm run android` (if using emulator)
5. see results on localhost:8081

required dependencies have been installed so it should run as it should. 
if `npm run web` does not work, error should pop up saying you dont have the required web dependency
and then you can install said dependency.

anything new you add, make sure to install any necessary dependencies

This framework did not come with its own README.md file so this is my own version
